# CNN-on-Fashion-MNIST-achieves-95-accuracy-on-test-data-using-augmentation-and-ensemble-methods
A Jupyter notebook presents a CNN on Fashion MNIST that achieves 95% accuracy on test data. The best model of 95.03% on the test data is saved in h5 format as best_cnn1_3.h5. In solving the problem, I also use ensemble methods and I manage to achieve a measure of accuracy equal to 95.36% on the test set.
A detailed description of the solution can be found in the notebook.
